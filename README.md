TRAFFIC LOAD MINIMIZATION AND MONITOR USING WSN AND IOT

Traffic Signal System or traffic monitoring is a vast domain where WSN can be applied to gather
information about the traffic load on a particular road, incoming traffic flow, traffic load at particular
period of time (peak hours) and in vehicle prioritization. Wireless Sensor Networks deployed along
a road can be utilized to control the traffic load on roads and at traffic intersections. Sensors are
deployed on either side of roads at intersection points and in emergency vehicles respectively.

These sensors run on both solar energy as well as battery. During bright and sunny conditions these
sensors have the capability to draw solar energy from sun light and use battery power for
functioning during night and cloud and foggy condition Consider a scenario of highly congested area
where many vehicles such as personal transport, public transport and emergency vehicles
(Ambulance, Fire brigade, VIP cars and other rescue vehicles) have to wait for long for the change
of traffic signals at intersection points. Existing traffic light systems have timers that are set at
regular intervals. This leads to the wastage of precious time especially in case of rescue vehicles for
emergency conditions.
In order to control this situation, we have a system consisting of two parts:
Smart Traffic Light Control System (STLC) and Smart Congestion Avoidance System (SCA) during
emergencies. STLC System controls the change of traffic lights at intersection points giving high
priority to emergency vehicles. SCA System is a smart traffic routing system that chooses the shortest
routes having the least congestions.
